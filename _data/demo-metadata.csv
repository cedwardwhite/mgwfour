The floral band on the stem is typical of Arts and Crafts decoration, as nature was cited by many craftsmen as the main inspiration for their work. This compote was made by Julius Olaf Randahl, the first professional silversmith of The Kalo Shop, and later the founder of The Randahl Shop. Randahl opened his shop in Chicago in 1914 but soon closed it in order to join the war effort. The storefront reopened after the war and continued to operate until 1965. Unlike many of the craftsmen represented here, who exclusively produced hand-wrought silver through the 1940s, Randahl switched to producing mostly machine-made objects in the 1920s. Adopting machine technology earlier than his peers meant that Randahl could devote his time to experimenting with new designs. Randahl also differed from the other silver shops in that he sold his hollowware through department stores and jewelry shops, rather than just from his storefront.","The Randahl Shop;American;Sterling silver;Chicago, Illinois","Chicago, Illinois",,,JSMA2014:39.13,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg

By using more advanced mechanical techniques, Dresser had more freedom to construct a wide variety of creative and complex forms in large quantities. Many of his designs still look fresh and modern to today’s audiences. His innovative designs, not only in metalwork but also in textiles, wallpaper, carpets, ceramics, and furniture, made Dresser an extremely influential figure in the design world.

The tea set—with tea pot, creamer, sugar bowl, and other accoutrements—was transformed into its own luxury good for upper class patrons. The Industrial Revolution of the mid-19th century, and its resultant improvements in packing and shipping, facilitated the importation of tea and broadened its appeal to all social classes. During the early 20th century, silver tea sets became popular household items for the newly wealthy because they showed one’s improved financial status. In the later years of the Arts and Crafts period, when this tea set was made, the different items of a tea service were available for purchase separately. This meant that more middle class families were able to afford complete sets, since they were able to collect the pieces as finances allowed. This tea service includes a tea pot, coffee pot, creamer and sugar bowl.","Lebolt & Company;American;Sterling silver;Chicago, Illinois","Chicago, Illinois",,,JSMA2014:39.18a-d,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg

The wide handle, heavy base, and narrowed spout were all designed to improve its functionality. Its heavy appearance was intended to indicate the pitcher’s durability, another aspect that was important to the movement. Its weight contrasts with its textured and reflective surface. Silver’s light-reflective quality was prized by Arts and Crafts silversmiths, as light was a way for the objects to interact with nature. The simple form, shiny finish and visible hammer marks all allow light to become the design focus.","The Randahl Shop;American;Sterling silver;Chicago, Illinois","Chicago, Illinois",,,JSMA2014:39.19,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg

The Randahl Shop, similar to most producers of the time, offered a wide variety of household objects in the same pattern, which created a set. This same pattern would have been available for other objects as part of a dinner service, such as serving bowls or silverware.  
During the early 20th century, purchasing silver was like starting an ongoing collection. In a 1937 book, The Story of Sterling, published by the Sterling Silversmiths Guild of America, the author writes about the importance of choosing the right silver pattern.  The author warns that when choosing a pattern, the longevity of the style and availability of the pattern in the future is of the utmost importance. This is because silver would ideally be passed down to younger generations, who could continue to add to the set.","Randahl, Julius Olaf; The Randahl Shop;American;Sterling silver;Chicago, Illinois","Chicago, Illinois",,,JSMA2014:39.2a-c,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg

They were a common way to personalize objects, particularly those given as gifts or bought to commemorate events. In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, monograms were made using three different techniques: engraving, applying, or saw-piercing. Applied monograms are seen on many of the objects in this display case. The applied technique involves cutting out a separate shape in silver, which is then soldered on to the object. Engraving involves etching into the surface with a sharp tool, and saw-piercing involves cutting out the monogram from the surface of the metal. The Kalo Shop and Lebolt & Company were both known for their artful monograms.","Lebolt & Company;American;Sterling silver;Chicago, Illinois","Chicago, Illinois",,,JSMA2014:39.21,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg

Founded by Clara Barck Welles in 1900, the shop was originally a group of six women. Nicknamed the “Kalo girls,” they were responsible for designing the items produced, while Scandinavian immigrants fabricated them. The Kalo Shop thus offered opportunities for women and immigrants not found elsewhere in Chicago at the time.
The Kalo Shop produced the widest ranges of handmade holloware, jewelry, and flatware in Chicago during the Arts and Crafts movement, but during World War I, their production changed. Silver became scarce, and many of Kalo’s silversmiths were sent overseas to fight in the war. The female employees of the Kalo Shop started producing smaller items and jewelry, enabling the shop to stay open during the war. Unfortunately, their New York storefront, which had opened in 1912 to accommodate a growing east coast clientele, closed in 1916 due to the wartime economy.","The Kalo Shop;American;Sterling silver;Chicago, Illinois","Chicago, Illinois",,,JSMA2014:39.22,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg

Holloware refers to objects that are constructed from flat pieces of metal and are intended for the table, such as tea sets, pitchers, and serving bowls. This pitcher was made using a technique called raising, which combines heat and hammering to form a hollow object. Hand-raising begins with a flat sheet of metal, which is first heated and then hammered on steel stakes to move the metal upwards into a hollow form. The process of hand-raising is very labor and time intensive. Hand-raising differs from machine-raising because every object produced is unique.

The company became a popular place to buy items for weddings or special occasions, and offered trophies, flatware sets, trays, vases, bowls, serving pieces, coffee and tea services, trays and candelabra.  Lebolt & Company produced hollowware that was similar to that of the Kalo Shop, but was often less expensive. However, Lebolt’s tea sets and pitchers often rivaled those of Kalo and commanded comparable prices.

Sidel emigrated from Poland to New York as a young man and established himself as a silversmith, first in the Bronx and later on Long Island. Sidel lived above the dry goods and furniture store he operated in Inwood before moving to nearby Cedarhurst. This sauceboat dates to his most prolific period of production. It features beautiful floral decoration that would have been very time intensive to produce for a one-man operation. In his later years, Sidel produced hand-made wares for customers of his son’s large truck-leasing business in New York City. Sidel would often take the whole year to produce a gift for the biggest customers, which included newspapers and breweries. Unfortunately, because these hand-made objects were made as gifts, there is no record of their production.","Sidel, J.P.;American;Sterling silver;Cedarhurst, New York","Cedarhurst, New York",,,JSMA2014:39.42,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg

The hammered surface of this chocolate pot reflects the time-consuming process of making it by hand. While the simple lines are in keeping with the Arts and Crafts style, Friedell was better-known for his more ornamental work.

Petersen’s elegant design features a passage of floral beading that curves over the dish, inviting the viewer to enjoy the delights offered in the dish.

He eventually created a limited home collection starting in 1986, which included these serving pieces. Intertwined vines and grapes leaves, seen here, decorate all the objects in his home collection. He created the naturalistic foliage and beetle from molds from specimens found in his garden. Dweck considers giving new life to old styles his specialty. He associates the beetle (a signature motif he named Adam) with ancient Egyptian scarabs and the vines with classical laurel victory wreaths.  Only 50 sets of this particular design were produced, and it is no longer in production.","Dweck, Stephen;American;Sterling silver;New York, New York","New York, New York",,,"JSMA2016:12.20a,b",Image;StillImage,image/jpeg

The Lily of the Valley pattern references the floral designs of Japanese paintings and woodblock prints. The company was founded in 1866 in Attleboro, Massachusetts by William Dean Whiting. After a fire in 1875, the factory was moved to New York City, where it became one of the leading producers of sterling silver flatware, hollowware, and other decorative objects. The use of Japanese-inspired designs was a way to set Whiting apart from its main competitors, Gorham Manufacturing Company and Tiffany & Company. Unfortunately, this strategy was not successful in keeping the company afloat. Gorham acquired the company in 1924 but continued to make silver under the Whiting name until 1926.","Whiting Manufacturing Co.;American;Sterling silver;New York, New York","New York, New York",,,"JSMA2016:12.23a,b",Image;StillImage,image/jpeg

The Arts and Crafts movement began in Britain during the mid-19th century and later gained popularity in the United States, particularly in Chicago. Chicago-based department store Marshall Field & Company added a craft shop and metal foundry around 1904. The shop was established to capitalize on the popularity of the Arts and Crafts movement, which privileged handmade objects, often with a hammered surface. Marshall Field and Company’s shop manufactured mostly machine-made silver and jewelry. To achieve the look of a handmade piece, artisans would apply a hand-hammered finish. The works for sale thus mimicked the look of handmade objects but at a fraction of the price.","Marshall Field & Company Craft Shop;American;Sterling silver;Chicago, Illinois","Chicago, Illinois",,,"JSMA2016:12.24a,b",Image;StillImage,image/jpeg

In addition to these more modern designs, International Silver Company continued to produce traditional patterns for their more conservative clientele. The company’s many different divisions offered a wide variety of objects and styles, including silver for hotels, trains, airplanes, passenger ships, and even for prizes in cereal boxes, in addition to their domestic wares.","Kintz, Alfred G.; International Silver Company;American;Sterling silver;Meriden, Conneticut","Meriden, Conneticut",,,JSMA2016:12.26,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg

American silversmiths capitalized on the popularity of the modern, sleek styles produced by their Scandinavian counterparts. California-based silversmith Allan Adler became extremely well known for his Scandinavian-influenced style, gaining commissions for President John F. Kennedy, Winston Churchill, Katharine Hepburn and many other celebrities, as well as the crowns for Miss America and Miss Universe. Originally, Adler had no intention of entering the silver business. It wasn’t until he married Helen Rebecca Blanchard, daughter of the famous Arts and Crafts silversmith Porter Blanchard, that he became the apprentice to his father-in-law. When Adler opened his own shop in 1939, he broke away from the Arts and Crafts tradition, referring to his style as “clean lines with a bend towards the unconventional.” Adler remained a silversmith to the stars until his death in 2002, although his company, Allan Adler Designs Inc., remains in business today.","Adler, Allan;American;Sterling silver;Los Angeles, California","Los Angeles, California",,,"JSMA2016:12.56a,b",Image;StillImage,image/jpeg

Known primarily for his jewelry, Spratling also designed hollowware and serving sets, often incorporating rosewood, ebony, and mahogany into his designs. A professor of architecture at Tulane University, Spratling was an early promoter of Mexican artists, such as Diego Rivera, in the United States. He moved to Taxco, Mexico in 1926 and began experimenting with silver because of the silver mines located there. He started to design jewelry in 1931, quickly gaining recognition and opening a workshop by 1933. At the peak of his success, he had around 400 silversmiths working in his shop. Spratling was adding ten new designs a week during 1939–40, but his workshop ceased production in 1946 due to over-expansion. He continued to design silver for other workshops until his death in 1967.","Spratling, William;Mexican; American;Sterling silver with rosewood;Taxco, Mexico","Taxco, Mexico",,,"JSMA2016:12.6a,b",Image;StillImage,image/jpeg
